# ðŸ§  Code Compiler - Syntax Checker (Stack-Based)

This is a simple **web-based syntax structure checker** that uses a **stack-based algorithm** to validate if the code has properly matched brackets: `()`, `{}`, and `[]`.

It is ideal for educational projects, demonstrations of stack use in syntax checking, and basic validation before actual compilation.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This web application allows users to input code and checks if the syntax structure is valid by using a **stack** to match opening and closing brackets. It helps identify mismatched or unclosed brackets which are common in programming.
